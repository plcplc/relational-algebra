# Relational Algebra DSL

This repository contains an experimental domain specific language embedded in
Haskell, modelling relational algebra.

It is formulated using the "Tagless Final" approach, inspired by
https://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/quel.pdf, but using primitives from
relational algebra rather than iterative looping.
